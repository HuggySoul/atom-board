# AtomBoard

This is a simple application that displays charts.

## Step-by-step installation:

1. Check for node.js on your PC by using `node -v` command. If you have't installed it before, then install it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2. Check your Angular version by using `ng version` - it should be `18.2.10`. If it isn't run the `npm install -g  @angular/cli@18.2.10`.
3. Run the `npm install` command in the cloned project folder to install node modules.
4. Execute one of the available scripts, which are described below.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
